# What is Destrix Plus?

[Destrix Plus](plus/index.md) is a subscription membership that supports Destrix. Coming up soon, Destrix Plus will offer both exclusive commands and an early preview into new and upcoming commands. It's mostly a donation subscription with a few extra perks. This subscription should help Destrix maintain itself and progress to what it can be. Destrix Plus will apply to every experience that uses Destrix and hasn't [opted-out](https://wolfite.dev/?to=destrix/opt-out).

## Destrix Plus Enterprise
<!-- more -->

[Destrix Plus Enterprise](plus/enterprise/index.md) sounds a lot grander than it is. Destrix Plus Enterprise is a more costly subscription (currently planned at $14.99) which allows one account to purchase it, and for all it's games/group games, every moderator will recieve Destrix Plus for that experience. The price may be increased at a later date when 1) Roblox adds supports for a higher price point and 2) Roblox allows creators to change subscription prices.

## When is this coming out?

Destrix Plus has no release date. The release date is dependant on when Roblox allows subscriptions to be sold cross-experience. If this happened tommorow, that does not mean Plus would be ready yet.
