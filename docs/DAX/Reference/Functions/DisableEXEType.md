DisableEXEType is the function responsible for disable commands by type. Rather than disabling individual commands, you can disable them by [type](/DAX/Reference/CommandTypes/). These are not the same as categories.

## Try it
#### Parameters
| Name         	| Type   	| Default  	| Description                                                                                            	|
|--------------	|--------	|----------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Command Type 	| string 	| Required 	| The type of commands you want disabled.                                                                	|
| Players      	| table? 	| nil      	| The players you want the commands to be disabled for. If blank, they will be disabled for all players. 	|

#### Examples

The example below will disable all of the commands that interfere with user interface not from Destrix, for all players.

``` lua
DAX:DisableEXEType("ui-interference")
```

The example below disables all of the commands that interfere with user interface not from Destrix just for just 1 player, @WWolfite (game.Players.WWolfite).

``` lua
DAX:DisableEXEType("ui-interference", {game.Players.WWolfite})
```
