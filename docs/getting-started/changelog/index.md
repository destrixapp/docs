Note worthy changes will be added here.

??? tip "How to update Destrix"

    === "After 0.1.2"
        When Destrix is updated it should automatically be changed if you are using the correct loader. This will happen upon ever new server's creation. Servers that are created before an update will have to close before Destrix is fully updated in your experience. **Having issues?** Try running [`/dversion`](../../Commands/specifics/dversion.md) to get the current version. Note that some updates here may be in advanced, not released yet, or for other versions. If Destrix isn't updating when it should be, try re-installing it.
    === "Before 0.1.2"
        Installations prior to 0.1.2 may need to be completely re-installed due to the lack of support for the settings module.
