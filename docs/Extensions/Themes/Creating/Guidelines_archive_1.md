## Guidelines

### __1. Controversial__
Themes can not "controversial," this means themes can not contain content that could be considered controversial, such as a theme presented to be in support of a specific opinion like a political party, human rights, etc.

### __2. Security__
Your theme should not violate our Extenstion Security Policy.

### __3. Bodily Parts__
Themes may not contain or be based around anything relating to themes of bodily parts, such as skin, blood, waste, etc.

### __4. Copyrighted Material__
Themes can not contain content that does not belong to the creator or is not in public domain. Destrix has to have legal permission to the content for your theme to be uploaded and endorsed, otherwise, the risk is on you.

### __5. Original__
Themes must be mostly original. Please do not copy the themes of other Destrix users, and do not rip-off themes from other software, webistes, etc. Be mindful to change it so it is your original work.

### __6. Supported__
Your theme must not be affected by screen size. Meaning that all devices will be able to use Destrix normally if your theme is in use.

### __7. Personalised__
Themes can not be about you. You can not make your own theme about your brand, product, etc. Destrix will not endorse it, however you can use it for your own projects and can create themes about notable content creators and brands. We count any content creator with over 100,000 subscribers (YouTube), and 10,000 follows (Twitter) to be notable.

### __8. Warnings__
If your theme creates content that may cause complications for epileptic people, you must warn them within a reasonable amount of time before those risks appear.

We also encourage that your theme accessible to visually impaired people, such as those with affected color sight. Please note that if your theme falls into disrepair for a long amount of time, it may be removed from our repository and no longer available.

## Disclaimer
If your theme abides by these rules that does not gurantee that your theme will still be endorsed. Please note that these guidelines are also subject to change, and your theme will be removed if it violates the updated guidelines even if it was previously aloud.
