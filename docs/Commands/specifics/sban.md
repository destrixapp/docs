Unlike [/ban](/Commands/specifics//ban/), which bans a player from all servers, this command bans them from the specific game server the command is fired from. Players cannot rejoin that specific server, but can rejoin the universe in other servers as they please. Once the server closes, due to inactivity or shutdown, they will be able to rejoin all servers. This command does not ban the player from servers you are in, just the specific server. If you wish to ban players from all servers, use [/ban](/Commands/specifics/ban/).

Arguments: Player : player
