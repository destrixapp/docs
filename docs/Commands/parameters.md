# Parameters

## What are parameters?
Parameters are specified information a command asks for. Parameters are also referred to and may be known as Arguments, especially in other systems. For example, the [:material-block-helper: /ban](/Commands/specifics/ban/) uses parameters: Player, Reason, and Moderator Note. So, the command looks like `/ban Username`, without parameters, it would just look like `/ban` with no username.

## Parameter Types
:material-information: This part of the documentation has not been completed. Please wait until Destrix is confirmed.

## Special Use-cases
### Two string parameters next to eachother.
If a command requires or can recieve 2 or more string paramaters consecutively, separate them with '||'. For example, `/ban @1Wolfite This is the reason||This is the moderator note`.
